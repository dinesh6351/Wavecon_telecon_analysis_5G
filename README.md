## About Wavecon

Wavecon is a leading telecommunications firm that has recently launched its 5G service. The company aims to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of this launch on its key performance indicators (KPIs) and to analyze the performance of its 5G plans over time.

## Objective

The goal is to develop an ad-hoc analysis dashboard to provide insights into the following questions:

- What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
- Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
- Which plans are performing well in terms of revenue after the 5G launch? Which plans are not performing well?
- Are there any plans significantly affected by the 5G launch? Should these plans be continued or discontinued?
- Which plans have been discontinued after the 5G launch, and what are the reasons for their discontinuation?

By answering these questions, we aim to provide actionable insights to help Wavecon make informed decisions about their 5G plans and overall strategy.
